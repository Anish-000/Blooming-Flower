# Blooming Flower


Blooming Flower is a simple yet beautiful web project that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea behind this project was to create an animated flower that visually blooms on the screen, showing how a bit of creativity and code can come together to build something visually engaging.

The animation is entirely built from scratch without using any external libraries or frameworks. I focused on smooth transitions, color combinations, and overall design to give the flower a natural blooming effect. It’s a great example of using basic web technologies to create something fun and interactive.
